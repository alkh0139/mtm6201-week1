    <p>I am a versatile individual with a passion for knowledge and creativity. With a diverse background in both technology and the arts, I combines my analytical skills with a keen eye for aesthetics to deliver unique solutions. I  want to get a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and get experience in software development, data analysis, and artificial intelligence. However, my true passion lies in storytelling and visual arts, where I expresses my creativity through photography and graphic design. Through my work, I aim to inspire and connect with others, offering a fresh perspective on the world. When Im not immersed in my projects, I enjoys traveling, exploring new cuisines, and engaging in outdoor activities.</p>
